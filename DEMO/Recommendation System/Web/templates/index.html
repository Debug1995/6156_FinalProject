This wide adoption of DL techniques presents new challenges as the predictability and correctness of such systems are of crucial importance. Unfortunately, ML systems, despite their impressive capabilities, often demonstrate unexpected or incorrect behaviors in corner cases for several reasons such as biased training data, overfitting, and underfitting of the models. In safety- and security-critical settings, such incorrect behaviors can lead to disastrous consequences such as a fatal collision of a self-driving car. For example, a Google self-driving car recently crashed into a bus because it expected the bus to yield under a set of rare conditions but the bus did not. A Tesla car in autopilot crashed into a trailer because the autopilot system failed to recognize the trailer as an obstacle due to its “white color against a brightly lit sky” and the “high ride height.” Such corner cases were not part of Google’s or Tesla’s test set and thus never showed up during testing. Other examples include Microsoft’s Tay chatbot tweeting racist words because it was misled by malicious twitter users, and Google removing “gorilla” as an image class after its image classification algorithm incorrectly classified dark skined people as gorillas.","Network Security: Introduction to network security concepts and mechanisms.
